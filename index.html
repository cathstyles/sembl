<p>Sembl is a multi-player web-based board-game where the challenge is to make interesting connections. Etymologically it's related to assembly and resemblance and symbolism. Philosophically, it's designed to encourage people to overcome the modern Western tendency to think about the world in terms of things in isolation, and to nurture thinking in terms of the connections and the whole. The ideas behind it are big, but the principle of the play is simple and utterly intuitive: to make connections. (Making connections is what human brains do and what they have done since prehistorical times. We see patterns, without even thinking about it.) In each round of a Sembl game, players make connections and then rate others' – on a sliding scale of interestingness.</p>

<p>You can – and I hope you do! – <a href="http://play.sembl.net/">play a game</a>. If you're the cautious type, you might want to see this <a href="http://sembl.net">friendly introduction</a> first.</p>

<p>I conceived of Sembl and directed its initial production but I haven't ever worked in the code. (I'm not unwilling; it's just a learning-cliff I haven't yet scaled.) This is me <a href="https://twitter.com/cathstyles">on Twitter</a>, where I feel much more at home. I'm quite proud of these <a href="http://twitter.com/semblnet">Sembl tweets</a>. Code contributors? Yes, please. </p>

<a id="halp" class="anchor" href="#halp" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Halp!</h3>

<p>The games are out there and I've had good feedback from teachers, trainers and players. But being an initial release of a fairly complex system, there are some obstacles to the flow of play that need to be removed if the games are to fly. And I hope it does because it feels important. And now that I've spent all the money I won from <a href="http://www.business.act.gov.au/grants-and-assistance/grants/innovation-connect">InnovationConnect</a> on initial development by <a href="http://icelab.com.au">Icelab</a>, I'm pretty much on my own. I hope that is temporary! I always intended for this to be an open source project, but I've been fretting for months about releasing it because I felt that the documentation was too poor, and that I needed more knowledge and experience in order to coordinat an open source software project. </p>
