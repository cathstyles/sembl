<a id="what-is-sembl" class="anchor" href="#what-is-sembl" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Sembl?</h3>

<p>Sembl is a multi-player web-based board-game where the challenge is to make interesting connections. Etymologically it's related to assembly and resemblance and symbolism. Philosophically, it's designed to encourage people to overcome the modern Western tendency to think about the world in terms of things in isolation, and to nurture thinking in terms of the connections and the whole. </p>

<p>The ideas behind the game are big, but the principle of the play is simple and utterly intuitive: to make connections. (Making connections is what human brains do and what they have done since prehistorical times. We see patterns, without even thinking about it.) In each round of a Sembl game, players make connections and then rate others' – on a sliding scale of interestingness.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://play.sembl.net/">play a game</a> – and I hope you do! Or if you're the cautious type, see the <a href="http://sembl.net">friendly introduction</a> first.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and contributors</h3>

<p>I conceived of Sembl and directed its initial production but I haven't ever worked in the code. (I'm not unwilling; it's just a learning-cliff I haven't yet scaled.) I'm much more at home on Twitter – <a href="https://twitter.com/cathstyles">here's me</a>, and here's the account to follow if you enjoy juxtapositions, puns, rhymes and such, aka <a href="http://twitter.com/semblnet">relational thinking</a>. </p>

<p>Code contributors? Yes, please. Sembl's initial development was by <a href="http://icelab.com.au">Icelab</a> with funding from <a href="http://www.business.act.gov.au/grants-and-assistance/grants/innovation-connect">InnovationConnect</a>. Having spent the grant money, I'm pretty much on my own. I hope that is temporary! </p>

<p>So the games are out there and I've had good feedback from teachers, trainers and players. But being an initial release of a fairly complex system, there are obstacles to the flow of play that need to be removed if the games are to fly. And I hope it does (in some form) because it feels important. </p>

<p>Here's the (Trello'd) set of <a href="https://trello.com/b/LnGtUg4E/sembl-boardgame">known issues and ideas for further development</a>. I'd love to discuss them further with you.</p>

<a id="asides" class="anchor" href="#asides" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Asides...</h3>

<p><em>Testing</em> a multi-player game is exponentially more challenging than testing a solo-play game. I did not consider that when I embarked on this project. Duh. I did belatedly give some thought to how <a href="https://trello.com/b/zHL7nbI0/sembl-pairs">a solo-play version</a> of the game might work. It's more of a toy, really. </p>

<p>It seems crazy to abandon something that mostly works in favour of something that doesn't exist. But maybe that is the smartest way forward. I don't know. What do you reckon?</p>
