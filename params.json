  "body": "### What is Sembl?\r\nSembl is a multi-player web-based board-game where the challenge is to make interesting connections. Etymologically it's related to assembly and resemblance and symbolism. Philosophically, it's designed to encourage people to overcome the modern Western tendency to think about the world in terms of things in isolation, and to nurture thinking in terms of the connections and the whole. The ideas behind it are big, but the principle of the play is simple and utterly intuitive: to make connections. (Making connections is what human brains do and what they have done since prehistorical times. We see patterns, without even thinking about it.) In each round of a Sembl game, players make connections and then rate others' – on a sliding scale of interestingness.\r\n\r\nYou can [play a game](http://play.sembl.net/) – and I hope you do! If you're the cautious type, you might want to see the [friendly introduction](http://sembl.net) first.\r\n\r\n### Authors and contributors\r\nI conceived of Sembl and directed its initial production but I haven't ever worked in the code. (I'm not unwilling; it's just a learning-cliff I haven't yet scaled.) I'm much more at home on Twitter – [here's me](https://twitter.com/cathstyles) and here's the account to follow if you enjoy [juxtapositions, puns, rhymes and such](http://twitter.com/semblnet). \r\n\r\nCode contributors? Yes, please. Sembl's initial development was by [Icelab](http://icelab.com.au) with funding from [InnovationConnect](http://www.business.act.gov.au/grants-and-assistance/grants/innovation-connect). Having spent the grant money, I'm pretty much on my own. I hope that is temporary! \r\n\r\n### Halp!\r\nSo the games are out there and I've had good feedback from teachers, trainers and players. But being an initial release of a fairly complex system, there are some obstacles to the flow of play that need to be removed if the games are to fly. And I hope it does (in some form) because it feels important. \r\n\r\nHere's the (Trello'd) set of [known issues and ideas for further development](https://trello.com/b/LnGtUg4E/sembl-boardgame).",
