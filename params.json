I should tell you that I conceived of Sembl and directed the production but I haven't ever worked in the code. (I'm not unwilling, but it's a learning-cliff I haven't yet scaled.)\r\n\r\n### Or is it about me rather than the project?\r\nI'm [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cathstyles). \r\n\r\n### Authors and contributors\r\nI will add some credits here eg @srinivasandee.",
