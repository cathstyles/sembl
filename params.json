  "body": "### What is Sembl?\r\nSembl is a multi-player web-based board-game where the challenge is to make interesting connections between images of cultural heritage material. 'Sembl' is related to assembly and resemblance and symbolism. Philosophically, the games are oriented toward transcending the modern Western tendency to think about the world in terms of *things in isolation* – to cultivate thinking in terms of the *connections between* and the whole. \r\n\r\nThe ideas behind the game are big, but the principle of play is simple and utterly intuitive: to make connections. Making connections is what human brains do and what they have done since prehistorical times. We see patterns, without even thinking about it. In each round of a Sembl game, players make connections and then rate others' – on a sliding scale of interestingness.\r\n\r\nSee the [full, friendly introduction](http://sembl.net), how it works [for teachers](http://sembl.net/about/products-services/for-school-teachers/) and [for museums](http://sembl.net/about/products-services/for-museums/) – or just jump in and [play a game](http://play.sembl.net/).\r\n\r\n### Authors and contributors\r\nI conceived of Sembl and directed its initial production but I haven't ever worked in the code. (I'm not unwilling; it's just a learning-cliff I haven't yet scaled.) I'm much more at home on Twitter – [here's me](https://twitter.com/cathstyles), and here's the account to follow if you enjoy juxtapositions, puns, rhymes and such, aka [relational thinking](http://twitter.com/semblnet). \r\n\r\nCode contributors? Yes, please. Sembl was initially developed by [Icelab](http://icelab.com.au) with funding from [InnovationConnect](http://www.business.act.gov.au/grants-and-assistance/grants/innovation-connect). Having spent the grant money, for now the project is almost solely dependent on me. If I can nurture it to the point of self-sustaining, we all win.  \r\n\r\n### Haaalp\r\nSo the games are out there and I've had good feedback from teachers, trainers and players. But being an initial release of a fairly complex system, there are obstacles to the flow of play that need to be removed if the games are to fly. And I hope it does (in some form) because it feels important. (Eg relational thinking is a key to understanding systems and we all need that.) \r\n\r\nHere's a set of [known issues](https://trello.com/b/LnGtUg4E/sembl-boardgame) and ideas for further development. I'd love to discuss them with you – and yes, it might be better to transfer them back into GitHub as Issues. \r\n\r\nAside from coding, you could help by:\r\n* sharing this page with any and *everyone you think might be interested* in it\r\n* inviting your friends and associates to play; sharing what you like about it; and reporting any [issues]https://github.com/cathstyles/sembl/issues) you encounter\r\n* joining a group\r\n\r\n### Asides...\r\n\r\nThere are many forms that Sembl could take. Something I wish I had considered before I embarked on this project is that *testing* a multi-player game is exponentially more challenging than testing a solo-play game. Duh. \r\n\r\nI did belatedly give some thought to how [a solo-play version](https://trello.com/b/zHL7nbI0/sembl-pairs) of the game might work. It's more of a toy, really. \r\n\r\nThen there's the idea for a visual spatial concept and content mapping tool, and a set of ideas about small-scale widgets for creating and sharing resemblance-pairs... For now, though, I am devoting my Sembl energy to the existing multi-player boardgame form – because it exists.",
