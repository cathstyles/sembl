  "body": "### What is Sembl?\r\nSembl is a multi-player web-based board-game where the challenge is to make interesting connections (between openly-licensed images of cultural heritage material). 'Sembl' is related to assembly and resemblance and symbolism. Philosophically, the games are oriented toward transcending the modern Western tendency to think about the world in terms of *things in isolation*, and to nurture thinking in terms of the *connections between*, and the whole. \r\n\r\nThe ideas behind the game are big, but the principle of play is simple and utterly intuitive: to make connections. Making connections is what human brains do and what they have done since prehistorical times. We see patterns, without even thinking about it. In each round of a Sembl game, players make connections and then rate others' – on a sliding scale of interestingness.\r\n\r\nJump in and [play a game](http://play.sembl.net/). Or if you're the cautious type, see the [friendly introduction](http://sembl.net) first.\r\n\r\n### Authors and contributors\r\nI conceived of Sembl and directed its initial production but I haven't ever worked in the code. (I'm not unwilling; it's just a learning-cliff I haven't yet scaled.) I'm much more at home on Twitter – [here's me](https://twitter.com/cathstyles), and here's the account to follow if you [enjoy juxtapositions, puns, rhymes and such](http://twitter.com/semblnet), aka relational thinking. \r\n\r\nCode contributors? Yes, please. Sembl's initial development was by [Icelab](http://icelab.com.au) with funding from [InnovationConnect](http://www.business.act.gov.au/grants-and-assistance/grants/innovation-connect). Having spent the grant money, I'm pretty much on my own. I hope that is temporary. \r\n\r\n### Haaalp\r\nSo the games are out there and I've had good feedback from teachers, trainers and players. But being an initial release of a fairly complex system, there are obstacles to the flow of play that need to be removed if the games are to fly. And I hope it does (in some form) because it feels important. (Eg relational thinking is a key to understanding systems and we all need that.) \r\n\r\nHere's a set of [known issues and ideas for further development](https://trello.com/b/LnGtUg4E/sembl-boardgame). I'd love to discuss them with you.\r\n\r\n### Asides...\r\n\r\n*Testing* a multi-player game is exponentially more challenging than testing a solo-play game. I did not consider that when I embarked on this project. Duh. I did belatedly give some thought to how [a solo-play version](https://trello.com/b/zHL7nbI0/sembl-pairs) of the game might work. It's more of a toy, really. \r\n\r\nIt seems crazy to abandon something that mostly works in favour of something that doesn't exist. But maybe that is the smartest way forward. I don't know. What do you reckon?",
